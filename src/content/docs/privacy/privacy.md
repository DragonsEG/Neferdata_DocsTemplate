# How We Use Your Information

We extract and aggregate market insights about the services our customers utilize. This is done leveraging state of the art Artificial Intelligence technology. These insights undergo a rigorous depersonalization process, ensuring that they can never be linked back to you as an individual.

Depending on the Service(s) your have enabled, we may leverage the information you shared to help us learn how to protect you from unwanted emails and keep you productive.

We only retain local copies of information that is required to perform our Services. Once we have extracted the depersonalized insights, we promptly and permanently remove the message content from our systems. We only retain metadata about the messages that helps you manage your inbox. You have the ability to decide what specific metadata you would like to have removed after insights processing.

We take internal technical and organizational measures to prevent unauthorized access to your data.
