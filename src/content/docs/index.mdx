## Transparency through Privacy

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Global instance" icon="rocket">
	Easiest way to take advantage of Neferdata. Just sign up and start using the tools. You still have full control of what metadata is stored in our system.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Self-hosted solution" icon="github">
If you require enterprise-grade security you can run Neferdata in your own infrastructure. Keep your data while retaining full access to all latest features.

	</Card>
	<Card title="Enterprise managed service" icon="random">
Experience the same benefits of a dedicated & isolated instance without the IT overhead. We manage Neferdata for you without having any access to your data.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Read the docs" icon="open-book">
		Learn more in [our documentation](/privacy/privacy/) about how we handle your data and what we do to protect your privacy.
